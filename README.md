> A scalable data warehouse built with efficient ETL process to ensure data integrity and accuracy for fraud detection, along with an ML model and some analytical insights.
>
> CreditGuard aims to prepare well structured data in a data warehouse for analysis, and to prepare an ethical ML model for fraud prediction to proactively manage risks while using a dashboard to visualize insights and support informed decision-making.

### User Stories
- As a data engineer, I want a scalable data warehouse, so I can manage large volumes of transaction data accurately.
- As a data scientist, I want an explainable and clean fraud detection model, so I can predict fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and fairness.
- As a business analyst, I want an iteractive dashboard, so I can visualize fraud trends and risk factors.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

###  CreditGuard is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). Pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- For the ML model, the project uses the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) that is a simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis.
- To store the data warehouse, the project uses the [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/) for data warehouse storage, development, and administration.
